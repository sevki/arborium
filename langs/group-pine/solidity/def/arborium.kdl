    description "Solidity is a programming language for implementing smart contracts on various blockchain platforms, most notably, Ethereum."
    link "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidity"
    trivia "Solidity doesn't have native support for floating-point numbers by design. Floating-point arithmetic can produce slightly different results on different machines, which would break blockchain consensus, so everything is done with integers and fixed-point math."
